 <h1>My Favorite Video Game</h1>
 <h2>ULTRAKILL</h2>
 <p>MANKIND IS DEAD. HELL IS FULL. BLOOD IS FUEL. That is the opening quote to a video game named ULTRAKILL. ULTRAKILL is a fast paced FPS where you play as a robot named V1 going through the layers of hell with one goal, fuel. Ultrakill is my favorite game because of its amazing soundtrack, amazing lore, and its difficult but fun gameplay. In this game you have a very large arsenal of weapons. These weapons are the pistol, shotgun, nailgun, railcannon, and rocket launcher. Each weapon has 3 variants each that can be equipped all at the same time. Some weapons have ALTERNATES which change how a weapon behaves. </p>

 <p>This game has very unique healing mechanics. You heal by dousing yourself in fresh blood, parrying an attack, or collecting a RED secret orb. There arent only weapon variants in this game, but there are ARM variants aswell. At the beginning of the game you start with the BLUE arm called the Feedbacker. By pressing F you punch with the arm dealing little damage BUT this arm allows you to use the PARRY mechanic. By punching an enemy attack or projectile with precise timing you parry it. At the CLIMAX of the Limbo layer you fight V2, the first major skill check boss of the game. Once you defeat V2 he drops the RED arm called the Knuckleblaster. By pressing F you punch with the arm dealing big damage and by holding the button you create a shockwave that can destroy a small group of weak enemies. This arm is better at dealing damage and crowd control but the downsides of this arm is that its slow, and 
you cant parry with it. At the CLIMAX of the Greed layer you fight V2 a second time. Once you defeat him the second time, you get the GREEN arm called the Whiplash which is currently the last arm you can get. By pressing R you shoot out a grappling hook which attaches to hook anchors and enemies. If you grapple a light enemy with the Whiplash you pull them toward you. But if you grapple a heavy enemy, it pulls you towards them</p>

 <p>The game is actually still in early access and not even finished yet. In the third and last ACT of the game there is only one layer called VIOLENCE. At the moment Hakita who is the creator of the game is improving old levels as well as some sounds and animations of the enemies. The layers of hell in this game are based off of Dantes Inferno. The layers in order are Prelude, Limbo, Lust, Gluttony, Greed, Wrath, Heresy, and Violence. Each layer a secret level entrance in one of the levels. Secret levels are just fun little games that have no relation with the story at all.</p>

 <p>ULTRAKILL has many enemies and I am going to name the enemy types currently in the game. Each enemy type has lore behind them. The "Husks" are the first enemy type which are the souls of people that were not of much value in the real world. They are the first type of enemy you fight. The second type is "Demons". Demons are made by HELL ITSELF and have a stone outer layer and blood red insides. The third type is "Machines". In ULTRAKILL all Machines of war are fueled by blood. You arent the only Machine that needs blood, other war machines are also in hell in search of fuel. The fourth enemy type are the "Angels". There are only 2 Angel enemies in the game right now which are the Virtues and Gabriel, Judge of Hell.</p>

 <p>ULTRAKILL also has these levels called PRIME SANCTUMS. There are currently 2 PRIME SANCTUMS in the game with the third and last one being in development. To Acces the PRIME SANCTUMS you must P-RANK each level in the ACT. P-1 containts 2 bosses, Flesh Prison and MINOS PRIME. MINOS PRIME is a prime soul. Prime souls are increadibly strong and dangerous. They start forming when person who has enough WILL, STRENGTH, and STATUS dies or gets killed. When King Minos was killed by Gabriel he started forming into a prime soul. The Angels where terrefied of its power and decided to trap it inside a prison before it can fully develop into a prime soul. He was considered the hardest boss in the game until P-2 released.
 </p>

 <p>P-2 is currently the HARDEST level in the game.</p>
